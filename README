# Homology Models

# building models using modeller 9.23 and a single template
# will add more scripts to generate models using multiple templates

# before running, please change the Path to templates and where models must be saved in making_models_single.py

# to run 
python making_models_single.py 3qh7_A.pdb T1001.ali

# saves the output and models in T1001-models

# to convert fasta to ali, use convert_fileformat_modeller.py, note: there are other useful scripts in the scripts folder 
# for running PSI-BLAST, HHsearch and to read the outputs and download PDBs from the search outputs
