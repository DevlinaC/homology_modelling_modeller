# Homology Models

# building models using modeller 9.23 and a single template
# added scripts to generate models using multiple templates too

# before running, please change the Path to templates and where models must be saved in making_models_single.py 
# and making_models_mult_templates.py

# to run using single template 
python making_models_single.py 3qh7_A.pdb T1001.ali

# to run using multiple templates
python making_models_mult_templates.py T1001 list_templates.txt

# saves the outputs and models in T1001-models and T1001-mult-models for single and multiple template prediction respectively

# to convert fasta to ali, use convert_fileformat_modeller.py, note: there are other useful scripts in the scripts folder 
# for running PSI-BLAST, HHsearch and to read the outputs and download PDBs from the search outputs
